Fluent Reports - Data Driven PDF Reporting Engine for Node.js

Install

`npm install fluentreports`



Features:

* Completely Data Driven.  You pass in the data; you tell it easily how to print the data, and it generates the PDF report.
* Headers, Footers, Title Headers, Summary Footers
* Grouping, nested grouping, and even more nested groupings...
* Auto-Summing (and other automatic totals like max/min/count)
* Sane defaults, and the ability to easily override not only the defaults but pretty much every aspect of the report generation.
* Images, Gradients, Text, Fonts, Lines, and many other PDF features supported.
* Page-able data loading
* Sub-Reports, Sub-Sub-Reports, etc...
* Bands (Tables/Grids) & Suppressed Bands (w/ column wrapping or column clipping)
* Free Flow Text
* Ability to override each part of the report for total customization of your report
* Fluent API
* Ability to put data over images; gradients, etc.
* Quickly generate complex reports with minimal lines of code.
* Colorization (& other cell changes) of text per cell in Bands


See the simple & stupid examples for a overview on how to generate a somewhat complex report.
In these reports I tried to throw in a chunk of the kitchen sink to try and give you and
idea how powerful the engine is.

Currently has 5 example reports showing:

* Simple Grid Report with Grouping
* Simple Account Summary Report (w/ color & grid for account balances)
* Simple Fax Cover Sheet (w/ image)
* Grid Report showing off Sub-Reports with auto-queries
* More complex invoice/proposal with grouping, headers, footers.
